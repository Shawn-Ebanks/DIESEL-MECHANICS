# Hydromechanical Diesel Fuel Injection Systems

Rotary distributor pumps, called the sleeve-metering pump and inlet-metering pump pressurize the fuel and send the right amount of fuel to the proper injector nozzle at the right time.

This area is really only for notes based on governors.

Bosch makes a sleeve-metering rotory distributor pump style.

- Variable speed governor = all speed governor
- Limiting speed governor = min - max governor
